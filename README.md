# Annotated papers
This repository contains some of my notes for the research papers we are reading/have read.

# Why Annotated papers

1. Reading papers is an essential job for all of us working in ML. Since there are a lot of upcoming papers, idea is to collate few of the important papers as per topics
2. Lot of papers need some background knowledge of other papers. Notes/highlights can help to relate to those
3. Highlights/annotations can help other team members to quickly go through the important ideas in the papers
